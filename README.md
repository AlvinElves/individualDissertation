## Project Title & Description
Smart City Visualisation by Lim Yi Hong, supervised by Robert S. 
Laramee. This is an individual dissertation module project from
the University of Nottingham. <br><br>
The project's goal is to develop a visualisation and AI model to
assist the City Council in understanding data gathered from the 
surrounding air quality. The AI Models can predict air quality 
values to support the City Council in maintaining the environment
by utilising the predicted values for optimisation.


## How to run the Software
The software codes are saved in the 'Code' folder. There are some
subfolders inside the 'Code' folder to clean up the codes and 
files. The data visualisation is divided into two categories: live
data and historical data. Data pre-processing and visualisation 
for each type of data are saved in separate subfolders, 'LiveData'
and 'HistoricalData'. <br><br>
The GUI.py file contains the main class used to run the software.
If you are running for the first time, you will need to import the
necessary library packages into the environment.


## Code Documentation
Sphinx is used to generate the documentation for the class and 
functions. The HTML website and Sphinx builder documentation are
saved in the 'docs' folder. The documentation HTML website files are
then placed in the 'build' subfolder. On the other hand, the
Sphinx builder files and codes are kept in the 'source' subfolder.
